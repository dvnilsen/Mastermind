In this version of Mastermind, a single player will start the game.  
The computer will generate a random code that the playwe must guess.
The player will select different color buttons to guess a code.
The game will match the colors and positions chosen by the player, and tell the player how many colors are right and in the right posision, how many are right but in the wrong position, and leave spaces blank if both are wrong.
When the player reaches 10 wrong guesses, the computer wins.
If the player guesses correctly, a "player wins" message will display.
In both cases, the game will remain inactive until the player chooses to start again.
